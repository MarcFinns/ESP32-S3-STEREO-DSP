# ESP32-S3 STEREO DSP BOARD

A board with ESP32-S3, ADC, DAC, LCD display for audio application and beyond. 
While these components can be connected in principle on any breakout board for prototyping, proper power decoupling and series terminator resistors are necessary to avoid noise and interference.
This board ensures that all signals are appropriately decoupled and routed, on a single layer PCB.

The board was used to develop the [PiratESP32 FM RDS STEREO ENCODER](https://github.com/MarcFinns/PiratESP32-FM-RDS-STEREO-ENCODER)

## Features

### ESP32 Board
- **ESP32-S3 N16R8** with dual-core processor with SIMD (vector) instructions to boost DSP applications
 **ADC**: PCM1808 I2S audio ADC (24 bit, up to 96 kHz sample rate, I2S slave)
- **DAC**: PCM5102A I2S audio DAC (16/24/32 bit, up to 192 kHz sample rate, I2S slave)
- **Display (optional)** ILI9341 320Ã—240 TFT LCD (SPI interface)
- **GPIO connector** for LED/buttons or anything else

## Important notes

- Some PCM1808 ADC breakout boards have a **very aggressive low pass filter** (the filter is optional from the datasheet, and they chose a wrong capacitor value). This results in a lowpass filter at 6Khz! If sound is muffled, you can just desolder the caps (or break them, it is fine). See picture

- The board is designed to be powered 
both from USB on the ESP and from the Vin, 
without conflicts. However, to enable the board 
to work when powered via USB, it is often 
necessary to connect a jumper on the ESP32-
S3 board that enables 5V out. 
The location of the jumper depends on 
the flavour of the development board! **Look it up!**

- The board can be powered with a power supply connected to the Vin connector (12v max) so that it can work standalone / when not connected to a PC via USB. To that end, a LDO is included in the schematic. It can be skipped if only USB power is necessary. The LDO (AMS1117 family) can be either ADJ or 5V fixed version. A solder jumper on the PCB is provided to select the version. If fixed, connect SJ1 jumper to GND. If adj, connect to R divider. **If left not connected, bad things will happen**

- The PCB and schematic in the folder are correct. The pictures are of my first prototybe that had some mistakes, corrected later!

- SMD components are 0805 size. If uneasy with SMD, one could just redesign the PCB with through hole, keeping the schematic and even the routing - just make it larger


## Breakout boards

The following breakout boards are matching the PCB.
If different ones are used, schematic is still valid but re-routing of the PCB might become necessary.
